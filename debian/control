Description: Implementation of the pir-8 ISA – emulator
 The pir-8 ISA, available at, https://github.com/thecoshman/pir-8,
 describes a custom computer architecture,
 the hardware for which is to be assembled from raw transistors Soon™.
 .
 This package contains just the emulator,
 you will need precompiled binaries to run,
 or the pir-8-emu-binutils package, containing an assembler and disassembler;
 additionally, pir-8-emu-devel contains development headers for building
 emulated hardware components.
